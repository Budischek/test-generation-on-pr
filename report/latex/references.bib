	abstract = {In object oriented software development, automated unit test generation tools typically target one class at a time. A class, however, is usually part of a software project consisting of more than one class, and these are subject to changes over time. This context of a class offers significant potential to improve test generation for individual classes. In this paper, we introduce Continuous Test Generation ({CTG}), which includes automated unit test generation during continuous integration (i.e., infrastructure that regularly builds and tests software projects). {CTG} offers several benefits: First, it answers the question of how much time to spend on each class in a project. Second, it helps to decide in which order to test them. Finally, it answers the question of which classes should be subjected to test generation in the first place. We have implemented {CTG} using the {EvoSuite} unit test generation tool, and performed experiments using eight of the most popular open source projects available on {GitHub}, ten randomly selected projects from the {SF}100 corpus, and five industrial projects. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of up to +58\% for branch coverage and up to +69\% for thrown undeclared exceptions, while reducing the time spent on test generation by up to +83\%.},
